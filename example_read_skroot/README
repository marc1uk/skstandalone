This is a very minimal demonstrator of reading SKROOT files.
It uses a TreeManager to open an SKROOT file and make a wrapper class,
retrieving pointers to the created objects. It then retrieves the TTree*
and uses it to loop over TTree entries directly.
Mainly it demonstrates the most minimal makefile, which uses implicit rules
defined in $(SKOFL_ROOT)/config.gmk to build the executable with the
necessary dependencies.
