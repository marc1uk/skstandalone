This demonstrates some more functionality of the "fortran interface" routines
(those defined in fortran_interface.cc, although they actually invoke the TreeManager,
which is entirely c++). The makefile is a little more fleshed out in order to make
things more explicit and allow the user some more control.
Originally this was going to be an analysis script, but it turned out to be unsuitable,
so it's probably more verbose than it needs to be.
